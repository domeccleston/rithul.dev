> â„¹ This is not a guide. This is just my experiences with self hosting

<br />

Hey programmers, This is Rithul here,

<br />

I have a couple of self hosted stuff, like my emails, my blog, even this website is self hosted, and a lot more. I have been self hosting for the past year, and I wanted to share my experiences with you guys.

<br />I have been using a lot of services like Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, and a
lot more. I was upset that I had to pay in a million places and I just wanted to
get rid of all of them. Even if it costed me a bit.
<br />

This website runs on a dedicated instance from [MyRoot](https://myroot.pw). Now, I had to get a domain, and I got one from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) and just renewed it till 2024, That's fun :)
